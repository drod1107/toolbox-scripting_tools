### Auto Chapter Marker Overview

#### What It Does

The `auto_chapter_marker` script reads an OpenShot project file to extract marker data. It then formats this data into a list of timestamps and labels suitable for YouTube chapter markers.

#### How to Use

1. **Prepare OpenShot Project**: Make sure you've added markers in your OpenShot project where you want the chapters to be.
2. **Export Project**: Save the project, which will create an `.osp` (JSON) file.
3. **Run the Script**: Use the command mentioned above.
4. **Check Output**: A text file named `youtube_markers.txt` will be generated, containing the formatted markers.
